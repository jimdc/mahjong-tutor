# Mahjong Tutor

A beginner‑first, interactive Mahjong learning experience. This project goes beyond static explanations by turning core concepts into visual drills, feedback loops, and step‑by‑step practice that builds real table intuition.

## What Makes It Better Than Reading Wikipedia
- You practice recognition, not just read definitions.
- You get immediate feedback and “why” explanations.
- You see turn flow, claims, and discard pools animated in context.
- You build intuition through repetition, not just memorization.
- You can track progress locally and focus on weak spots.

## Learning Path
1. Tile Quiz to learn names and visual motifs.
2. Glossary with analogies (chess/checkers) and Mandarin terms.
3. Practice drills to reinforce recognition and decision making.
4. Hand Coach to learn grouping, melds, and discards.
5. Rules and Winning pages to see full round flow and win structures.

## Interactive Modules
- **Tile Quiz**: SVG tiles with Unicode fallback, hover labels, “why it’s called that” notes, focus filter (All/Suits/Honors), and persistent stats.
- **Hand Coach**: Choose discards from real hands with grouped vs raw views, hints, and retry‑on‑wrong choices so you learn by correction.
- **Practice Hub**: Progress snapshot, recommended next drill, and a beginner path checklist.

## Practice Drills
- **Tile Recognition**: Winds, honors, suits, and dragon names (Zhong/Fa/Bai).
- **Table Flow**: Seat winds and prevailing wind drills.
- **Melds & Structure**: Meld identification, complete the chow, find the pair, winning hand types.
- **Decision Making**: Claiming discards (chow/pung/kong/win/pass) and discard safety.

## Visual Learning Aids
- Interactive turn flow with opponent lane and discard pool.
- Table view showing four seats and the shared pool.
- Wall and dead‑wall visuals to explain draws and replacements.
- Winning page with visual sequences and rule‑set differences.
- Glossary that builds from zero knowledge with analogies and color cues.
- History page that situates Mahjong culturally and regionally.

## Built For Beginners
- Clear language, minimal jargon, and progressive disclosure.
- Visual memory cues on every drill.
- Consistent feedback that explains why, not just correct/incorrect.

## Tech Notes
- 100% static site (no server required).
- Progress stored locally in the browser.
- Cache‑busted assets to keep updates visible.

## Next Logical Steps
- Scoring primers for common rule sets (Riichi, Chinese Official, American).
- Spaced‑repetition scheduling for drills.
- A simple table simulator for call priority and open melds.
- Accessibility options (high‑contrast, large tiles, reduced motion).
