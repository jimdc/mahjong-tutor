# Mahjong Tutor

A beginner‑first, interactive Mahjong learning experience. This project goes beyond static explanations by turning core concepts into visual drills, guided feedback, and adaptive practice that builds real table intuition.

## Why It’s Better Than Reading a Wiki Page
- You practice recognition, not just read definitions.
- You get immediate feedback and step‑by‑step “why” explanations.
- You see turn flow, claims, and discard pools in context.
- You build intuition through repetition and targeted drills.
- The tutor adapts to your weak spots and nudges you forward.

## Learning Path
1. Tile Quiz to learn names and visual motifs.
2. Glossary with analogies (chess/checkers) and Mandarin terms.
3. Practice drills to reinforce recognition and decision making.
4. Hand Coach to learn grouping, melds, and discards.
5. Rules and Winning pages to see full round flow and win structures.
6. Story Mode for a mentor‑guided sequence.

## Interactive Modules
- **Story Mode**: mentor‑guided lesson sequence with a narrative voice.
- **Tile Quiz**: SVG tiles with Unicode fallback, hover labels, “why it’s called that” notes, focus filter (All/Suits/Honors), and persistent stats.
- **Hand Coach**: choose discards from real hands with grouped vs raw views, hints, and retry‑on‑wrong choices.
- **Practice Hub**: progress snapshot, recommended next drill, and a beginner path checklist.
- **Next Up** (adaptive): a mentor‑styled recommendation card on every page.

## Practice Drills
- **Tile Recognition**: Winds, honors, suits, and dragon names (Zhong/Fa/Bai).
- **Table Flow**: Seat winds and prevailing wind drills.
- **Melds & Structure**: Meld identification, complete the chow, find the pair, winning hand types.
- **Decision Making**: Claiming discards (chow/pung/kong/win/pass) and discard safety.
- **Why Reveals**: Stepwise explanations in drills and Hand Coach.

## Visual Learning Aids
- Interactive turn flow with opponent lane and discard pool.
- Table view showing four seats and the shared pool.
- Wall and dead‑wall visuals for draws and replacements.
- Winning page with visual sequences and rule‑set differences.
- Glossary that builds from zero knowledge with analogies and color cues.
- History page that situates Mahjong culturally and regionally.

## Built For Beginners
- Clear language, minimal jargon, and progressive disclosure.
- Visual memory cues on every drill.
- Consistent feedback that explains why, not just correct/incorrect.

## Tech Notes
- 100% static site (no server required).
- Progress stored locally in the browser.
- Cache‑busted assets to keep updates visible.

## Next Logical Steps
- Scoring primers for common rule sets (Riichi, Chinese Official, American).
- Spaced‑repetition scheduling for drills.
- A simple table simulator for call priority and open melds.
- Accessibility options (high‑contrast, large tiles, reduced motion).
